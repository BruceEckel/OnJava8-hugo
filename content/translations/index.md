## Initiating a Translation

Contract should include translation agreements for:
- Print Book
- Ebook
- Translation of AtomicKotlin EDU exercises and solutions

When there are competing publishers, I will relay the current offer to all
publishers, including both the advance and the royalties. The decision will
be made based on the combination of the two, but with a strong weight towards
the advance.

## Advance

The advance represents your expectations of the book's sales. A low advance
indicates you don't think the book will do that well in your country.

The advance also represents your commitment to promoting and selling the book.
A low advance indicates that you are not willing to take that risk.

Some publishers want to connect a higher advance to lower royalties. I do not
consider the two to be connected.

Please understand that my goal in negotiating a high advance is the ability it
gives me to finance future projects. Also it's much simpler for me to focus
on advances.

## Royalties

Different countries calculate royalties differently. Please be clear on whether
your royalty percentage represents the wholesale or retail price of the book.
Put another way, does the royalty represent a percentage of the cover price
(retail) or is it a percentage of the price paid to the publisher by the
distributor or bookseller (wholesale)?
