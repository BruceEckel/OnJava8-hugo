Thinking in C: Foundations for Java

This presentation, created by Chuck Allison and developed by MindView LLC, is
an eSeminar which gives you an introduction to the C syntax, operators and
functions that Java syntax is based upon.

Hands-On Java eSeminar
----------------------

The *Hands-On Java eSeminar* is based on the 2nd edition of *Thinking in Java*.
There is an audio lecture and slides corresponding to every chapter in that
book. I created the seminar and I narrate the material on the eSeminar. The
eSeminar uses HTML5, so it should run on most modern browsers. There are trial
demos of the product. The *Hands-On Java eSeminar* is for sale
[Here](https://gumroad.com/l/HandsOnJava).
