***On Java 8*** covers version 8 of the Java programming language.
Version 2 (December 2021) includes independent supplemental subsections that cover **features through Java 17**. 
These can be seen in the [table of contents](https://leanpub.com/onjava8), in subsection titles that start with ***New Feature:***.

The author also wrote [Thinking in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Java-4th-Bruce-Eckel/dp/0131872486).

This book is intended for "dedicated beginners." It doesn't assume you know
anything about programming and takes you through the material step-by-step. At
the same time, the book *does* assume you are able to figure things out. It's
not a "dummies" or "idiot's" guide.

This book is too large to be published as a single volume so it is currently
published only [as an eBook]({{< ref "/ebook" >}} "On Java 8 eBook").
