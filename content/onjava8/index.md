***On Java 8*** is the book by Bruce Eckel that covers version 8 of the Java
programming language.

This book is intended for "dedicated beginners." It doesn't assume you know
anything about programming and takes you through the material step-by-step. At
the same time, the book *does* assume you are able to figure things out. It's
not a "dummies" or "idiot's" guide.

This book is too large to be published as a single volume so it is currently
published only [as an eBook]({{< ref "/ebook" >}} "On Java 8 eBook")

Here's the front cover:
